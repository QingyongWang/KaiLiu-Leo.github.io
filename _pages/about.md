Biography
======
I am currently an Assistant Professor in Discipline of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), N University, Australia, and an [Adjunct Fellow](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/zehong.cao) in School of Computer Science, University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Australia. Before joining CSU,  I received my PhD degree in Information Science and Engineering in NUDT. I personally have papers published in top-tier (ERA A*/A or JCR Q1) journals, such as IEEE TFS, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TCYB, IEEE TSMC-S, IEEE TBME, IEEE TCDS, IEEE TII, IEEE TIA, ESWA, and ACM TOMM, INS, NC, IJNS, NeuroImage and BiB.

My research interests cover neural computation, brain-computer interface, fuzzy sets and neural networks and deep reinforcement learning. Currently, I am mainly focusing on the capacity of the human-in-the-loop machine learning and applications. If you are a self-motivated student and keen on a research project to work with me, please drop me an email.

Research Interest
======
My research interests mainly focus on developing computational intelligence models for human-in-the-loop tasks. The topics include:

1. Computational Intelligence: Fuzzy Sets and Systems, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Game-based Artificial Intelligence
2. Neuro Informatics: Brain-Computer Interface, Multimodal Data Fusion, EEG Signal Processing

Recruitment
======
I am actively looking for self-motivated Honours, Master, and PhD students. The programming skill at least one programming language is required (Python, Java, C++, C, R and Matlab). Here, we have lots of opportunities to work closely with computer scientists, IT engineers, and biomedical engineers.

The PhD scholarships are funded by: (a) [Tasmania Graduate Research Scholarships](http://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/scholarships/international-scholarships) or (b) [China Scholarship Council (CSC)](https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/scholarships/other-scholarships). Please send me your resume, transcripts, and any publications if you are interested. See how to apply a PhD program [here](http://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/apply-now) and find my advertised PhD projects [here](https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-phd-projects/_nocache).
