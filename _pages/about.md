Biography
======
I am currently a Lecturer (equivalent to Assistant Professor in North American universities) in Discipline of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), University of Tasmania (UTAS), Australia, and an Adjunct Fellow in School of Computer Science, University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Australia. Before joining UTAS, I was a Postdoc Research Fellow in the Centre for Artificial Intelligence (CAI), UTS. I received my PhD degree in Information Technology in UTS, under the supervision of Prof. Chin-Teng Lin. I personally have papers published in top-tier (ERA A*/A or JCR Q1) journals, such as IEEE TFS, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TCYB, IEEE TSMC-S, IEEE TBME, IEEE TII, IEEE IoT, and ACM TOMM, INS, NC, IJNS and Scientific Data.

My research interests cover neural computation, brain-computer interface, fuzzy sets and neural networks and deep reinforcement learning. Currently, I am mainly focusing on the capacity of the human-in-the-loop machine learning and applications. If you are a self-motivated Honour / Master student and keen on a research project to work with me, please drop me an email.

Research Interest
======
My research interests mainly focus on developing computational intelligence models for human-in-the-loop tasks. The topics include:

1. Computational Intelligence: Fuzzy Sets and Systems, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Game-based Artificial Intelligence
2. Neuro Informatics: Brain-Computer Interface, Multimodal Data Fusion, EEG Signal Processing

Opening:
======
I am looking for self-motivated Honours, Master, and PhD students. Programming skill in at least one programming language is required (Python, Java, C++, C, R and Matlab) . There are lots of opportunities to work closely with computer scientists, IT engineers, and biomedical engineers.

The PhD scholarships are funded by: (a) Tasmania Graduate Research Scholarships or (b) China Scholarship Council (CSC). Please send me your resume, transcripts, and any publications if you are interested. See how to apply below.
