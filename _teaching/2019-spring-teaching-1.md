In this unit students will be introduced to the broad, inter-disciplinary area of human-computer interaction (HCI) with special emphasis on user interface design and brain-computer interfaces.

Lectures cover the design, development and evaluation of computing technologies and human interface technologies, to be used for either work or leisure purposes. Students will learn how to design, implement, and evaluate user interfaces, and how to rapidly iterate and revise your designs. The unit is a combination of lectures and tutorials with programming experiences. Students will complete design and/or evaluation tasks, literature reviews and presentations as part of the practical requirement of this unit.
